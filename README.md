# NASA Space Apps pitching repo
In this repo, you will find the code we worked on for the project which contains:
- The frontend
- The model we are working on for processing the data and provide an approximation in the plot compared to actual results

# Notes:
Please place the jupyter notebook in the main NASA Space Apps folder for it to work
